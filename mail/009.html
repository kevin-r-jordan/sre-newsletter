<span style="color:#808080; font-size:14px">// notoriousbfg.com</span><br />
One common developer bias is that old code is bad. The reason old code is often seen this way is because it takes longer to remember. Developers yearn for clarity but if they're not immediately able to recall under what circumstances some code was written (in a few seconds or less), they only see ambiguity.<br />

How should you structure a larger engineering organization, one with dozens (or hundreds) of engineers? There are many tradeoffs to consider, and no single right answer. But, there are some structures that work better than others. The most effective teams are stable, multi-disciplinary, aligned to product delivery.<br />

If you want to see whether or not your application can handle scale, just generate scale and see if it can handle it! It sounds straightforward enough. Nicholas Tietz-Sokolsky explains why it's not so simple.<br />

Russia, we now know, used SolarWinds' hacked program to infiltrate at least 18,000 government and private networks. The data within these networks, user IDs, passwords, financial records, source code, you name it, can be presumed now to be in the hands of Russian intelligence agents.<br />
