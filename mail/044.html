This week we announce a lot of new tools. I'm most excited about Visual Studio 2022 and the .NET 6 release, but there's some tidbits for querying AWS, on-call management, and guidelines for building serverless applications too.<br /><br />

If you can replace your functions with Wordpress, you probably made some bad decisions.<br />

Exciting news for C# developers like myself. I've been stuck using .NET Core 3.1 for production apps, but not .NET 6.0 is the next LTS release (supported for 3 years). Many are excited about hot reload which allows you to avoid rebuild + restarting your app to view a new change.<br />
