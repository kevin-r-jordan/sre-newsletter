You know how when you buy a new car, it seems like every other car on the road is the same as yours. How did you not notice that before? I feel like this is happening with observability. It's everywhere! <br /><br />

Gergely Orosz surveys 60 teams and then conducts follow up interviews with Paul Osman from Honeycomb and John Allspaw (one of the early pioneers of the DevOps movement).

Despite being a C# guy, Go is the language I recommend to anyone getting into web development for the first time. Darren Parkinson make a similar suggestion for network engineers by referencing Gornir, scrapligo, and many IaC tools.<br />

<span style="color:#808080; font-size:14px">// blog.timescale.com</span><br />
One thing is true of Prometheus metric data: there is a lot of it. As that data ages, individual samples become less important and we care more about the general trends and aggregates. TimescaleDB announced the beta release of Promscale, continuous aggregation that is more timely and accurate than recording rules in many circumstances. <br />

<span style="color:#808080; font-size:14px">// old.reddit.com</span><br />
This one has almost nothing to do with site reliability engineering. Angelina Lee shares a fake resume with a few some big name companies and experience like "Led team of 6 engineers to mine Ethereum on company servers" and "Organized team bonding through company potato sack race". The result are hilarious and a little depressing.<br />
