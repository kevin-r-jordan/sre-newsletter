A little over 10 years ago, a group of operations-oriented engineers decided they were fed up with software developers who didn't care if their code actually worked. Those engineers created the Velocity Conference in order to band together and to come together as a community. That community sparked a revolution known as DevOps.<br />

Datadog, moved their job system to Kubernetes. It took substantially more CPU time than before, yet completed jobs at a 40-50% slower rate. This post describes how they solved this performance regression. The solution involved some performance experiment design, light performance tuning, and timing analysis to get back to parity.<br />

<span style="color:#808080; font-size:14px">// codeascraft.com</span><br />
For Etsy, 2020 was a year of unprecedented and volatile growth. Their site traffic leapt up in the second quarter, when lockdowns went into widespread effect, by an amount it normally would have taken several years to achieve.

A decent part of the proposals for a “new Kubernetes” are design choices made by Hashicorp's Nomad, which is a pretty underrated orchestrator, and drastically simpler.<br />

This is a discussion on the complexity of the SolarWind hack. Could SolarWind have been too difficult for the KGB to use them in an enablement operation? Yes. Of course, SolarWind wasn’t close to reaching that level.<br />
