This week we saw some great opinion pieces on RCAs and using versioning to encourage stable software. We also got some good technical content on containers.<br /><br />
Next week is Amazon's re:Invent conference. We're seeing a couple sneak previews this week and should get some really interesting features in the next SRE Newsletter.<br /><br />

Want to learn how containers REALLY work? Ivan Velichko shares another great post where he gives a learning plan for how he learned containers in depth. The article is a reasonable length, but links to a lot of other resources so that you can get a better understanding of what's happening under the hood.<br />

What does going from version 7.1.101 to 8.9.29 mean to you? Does version 2021-stable-29 make more sense?<br />

Everyone loves book lists, and it is close to that gift buying time of year... This list, however, intentionally skips the normal, "must read" books and gives you impractical ones instead.<br />

This article feels like it tries way too hard, but if I got the gist: the real world is not reproducible and we should embrace it. Since you can't test for everything, building for observability is key. Since perfection is not possible, error budgets are necessary.<br />
