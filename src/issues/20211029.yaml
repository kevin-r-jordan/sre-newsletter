introduction: |
    You know how when you buy a new car, it seems like every other car on the road is the same as yours. How did you not notice that before? I feel like this is happening with observability. It's everywhere! 
    My prediction, observability is THE buzz word for 2022. Expect to see job titles like "Observability Engineer". But, there are good trends and BS trends. Creating observable systems can be extremely valuable.

This post does a great job digging into what teams are doing today and how we can look to other industries to define better ways to handle incidents in the future, including getting rid of the blameless post-mortem."

      summary:    "One thing is true of Prometheus metric data: there is a lot of it. As that data ages, individual samples become less important and we care more about the general trends and aggregates. TimescaleDB announced the beta release of Promscale, continuous aggregation that is more timely and accurate than recording rules in many circumstances. "

      summary:    "This one has almost nothing to do with site reliability engineering. Angelina Lee shares a fake resume with a few some big name companies and experience like \"Led team of 6 engineers to mine Ethereum on company servers\" and \"Organized team bonding through company potato sack race\". The result are hilarious and a little depressing."
