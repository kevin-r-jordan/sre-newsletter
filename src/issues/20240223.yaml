introduction: |
    A few big outages hit the tech world this week. We spend a lot of time considering fault tolerance, scalability, and monitoring. But, it's important to consider that sometimes an outage is intentionally caused by an outside threat. 
    We must consider the relationship between reliability and security. While AT&T assures us that their issue wasn't caused by an cyber attack, Change Healthcare and many other's were.
