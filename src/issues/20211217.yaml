introduction: |
    It's been a rough week for site reliability engineers and other IT groups. Fresh off of the AWS outage last week we get another AWS outage. Azure also reported issues and there was latency in Cloudflare. Maybe we should go back on-prem. Was that production server under my desk really such a bad idea? /s
    Log4Shell probably has your IT department scrambling. If you're lucky, you're just responding to requests saying you're not affected. Those that are less lucky are busy updating their applications. In the worst shape are those that have no idea if they're at risk or how to find out.
