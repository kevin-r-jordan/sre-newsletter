introduction: |
    The big news this week is, of course, the AWS outage. I actually had 3 articles to review for the SRE Newsletter from AWS re:Invent, but parts of Amazon appear to still be down.
    The outage highlights a couple things: 1) if it makes sense for your application, use multiple regions and 2) outages happen even to the best of us.
