Many of the trends you see in software development and delivery can be understood as a cyclical reaction to anarchists running headlong into the invisible backhand of the free market.</description>

  <title>Code Age vs Time to Recall</title>

  <description>One common developer bias is that old code is bad. The reason old code is often seen this way is because it takes longer to remember. Developers yearn for clarity but if they're not immediately able to recall under what circumstances some code was written (in a few seconds or less), they only see ambiguity.</description>

  <description>SRE can help ensure that teams are customer-focused, even if the best way forward breaks the rules or requires you to re-write them. Two ways SRE accomplishes this are by fostering a culture of blamelessness and using SLOs to glean insights into the customers’ experience.</description>

  <title>What Is True Resilience? (Hint: It’s Not About Managing Risk)</title>
  <link>https://www.forbes.com/sites/googlecloud/2021/02/17/what-is-true-resilience-hint-its-not-about-managing-risk/</link>
  <description>True resilience isn't about managing a particular instance of risk, but being ready for anything through the way you operate. Today’s disasters may come from wild, unanticipated success (leading to traffic spikes) as much as devastating unforeseen failure (be that a natural disaster, a political event, or a system configuration error that cascades into a global outage). </description>

Their site traffic leapt up in the second quarter, when lockdowns went into widespread effect, by an amount it normally would have taken several years to achieve. If they over-scaled, there was a risk of wasting money. If they under-scaled, it could have been much worse for their sellers.</description>

  <title>HTTPWTF</title>
  <link>https://httptoolkit.tech/blog/http-wtf/</link>
  <description>HTTP is fundamental to modern development, but like any widespread standard, it's got some funky skeletons in the closet. Some of these skeletons are little-known but genuinely useful features, some of them are legacy oddities relied on by billions of connections daily, and some of them really shouldn't exist at all.</description>

  <title>What Developer Self-Service Shouldn't Look Like</title>
  <link>https://humanitec.com/blog/what-developer-self-service-shouldnt-look-like</link>
  <description>When adopting DevOps, some organizations apply the "you built it, you run it" approach while others have an ops engineer do all the lifting. The vast majority, however, end up somewhere between. Recognize that Dev and Ops are two different skill sets and seek to achieve a balance that allows them to understand what's going on without leaving them to fail or get completely bogged down in operational support.</description>

  <description>GitHub was started 10 years ago as a simple Ruby application build on a single MySQL database. Over time, they've split out certain data, but eventually they moved to a partitioned database to support horizontal scaling. This is the story of how they executed that transition without downtime.</description>

  <title>The Case for Developer Experience</title>
  <link>https://future.a16z.com/the-case-for-developer-experience/</link>
  <description>[Long Read] There are more and more developers, which of course means more developer tools. Jean Yang breaks current tools into abstraction tools and complexity-exploring tools. There's been a lot of focus on abstraction tools, but software is increasingly complex and there's still a lack of tools that help developers deal with this complexity. She encourages the creation of new observability tools that work with existing ecosystems and companies to be willing to try these tools without expecting anything to be the silver bullet.</description>

  <description>I didn't particularly like this article, but it gained a lot of traction this week so it's worth sharing. The group at Real Kinetic somehow thought SRE always means microservices which always means developers can choose any language, tools, platform they want. Then they say that SRE doesn't scale because you'd have to hire an army to support this type of entropy. At the end of the article they admit that Google has standards and best practices negating their arguement.</description>

  <title>How We Cut Our Load Balancing Cost by More Than 96%</title>
  <link>https://www.setops.co/blog/aws-communism-part-1-how-we-cut-our-load-balancing-cost</link>
  <description>I've seen this a number of times... You're overpaying in the cloud because you've provision a resource per application or per service (such as a load balancer) either due to copy and pasting IaC files or some "best practice". Save some money. Share.</description>

  <title>Nomad vs. Kubernetes</title>
  <link>https://www.nomadproject.io/docs/nomad-vs-kubernetes</link>
  <description>If you're already familiar with HashCorp's Nomad skip this one, but K8s get's so much love, I thought this was worth sharing. Nomad offers an architecturally simpler alternative to Kubernetes. This article dives goes into more detail on why Nomad may be a better fit for your containers.</description>

  <description>Gergely Orosz surveys 60 teams and then conducts follow up interviews with Paul Osman from Honeycomb and John Allspaw (one of the early pioneers of the DevOps movement). This post does a great job digging into what teams are doing today and how we can look to other industries to define better ways to handle incidents in the future, including getting rid of the blameless post-mortem.</description>

  <title>A Different and (Often) Better Way to Downsample your Prometheus Metrics</title>
  <link>https://blog.timescale.com/blog/a-different-and-often-better-way-to-downsample-your-prometheus-metrics/</link>
  <description>One thing is true of Prometheus metric data: there is a lot of it. As that data ages, individual samples become less important and we care more about the general trends and aggregates. TimescaleDB announced the beta release of Promscale, continuous aggregation that is more timely and accurate than recording rules in many circumstances. </description>

  <description>IPv6 was introduced in 1995!? Kubernetes now supports using IPv4, IPv6, or both. If you decide to go with IPv6, you may be able to make more of your pods reachable from the internet. Helpful for many scenarios, but this also introduces new security risks.</description>

  <description>While this article doesn't get into the details, it's interesting when big companies move from their own data center into the cloud. I wish they would describe either their cost savings or operational efficiencies. It really just mentions that most of Atlassian's products are already in AWS and their "incidents dropped to zero" (obviously a limited sample).</description>

  <description>With so many teams being remote, I thought this would be another post on Slack based standups. Thankfully it's not, but instead replaces the idea of the 10 minute standup with a daily, hour long general purpose meeting. I'm a big believer in a daily touchbase with your team. The idea of a longer meeting, but not be popular, but may be worth trying out. Culture is key.</description>

If you can replace your functions with Wordpress, you probably made some bad decisions.</description>

  <description>How do you know if what you're doing is really the best (especially for us old guys that think we've seen it all)? By doing weekly mini experiments, you can constantly expose yourself to new ways of doing things and maybe pick up something new along the way. The post gives some good examples to try like: draw everything before typing, measure performance of a feature and improve it, or record the screen and watch yourself.</description>

  <link>https://github.blog/2021-11-10-make-your-monorepo-feel-small-with-gits-sparse-index/</link>
  <description>Git's sparse checkout feature allows you to pull down only a subset of files when working in large monorepos. However you'd still be working with the full Git index. The sparse index fixes this. After introducing this feature, for those that are intrested, this post dives into the actual implementation and performance results of Git's sparse index.</description>
